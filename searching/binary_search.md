# Binary Search

([Back to menu](/README.md))

## About

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. This is typically contrasted with a linear search, where you would examine all locations for the element in the worst case.
